Classes annotated with @Component are recognized by Spring as beans, meaning Spring creates and manages their lifecycle inside the ApplicationContext.

When the application starts (SpringApplication.run(...)), Spring performs a component scan and detects all such annotated classes.

In your case, BubbleSortAlgorithm and BinarySearchImpl are both components, so Spring creates beans for them.

The BinarySearchImpl class has a dependency on SortAlgorithm, marked with @Autowired.
This tells Spring to automatically inject a bean that implements the SortAlgorithm interface.

Since only BubbleSortAlgorithm has the @Component annotation (and not QuickSortAlgorithm), Spring finds just one matching bean and injects it.

When you call applicationContext.getBean(BinarySearchImpl.class), Spring doesn’t create a new object — it returns the already constructed bean, whose dependencies were injected earlier during startup.

Therefore, the sortAlgorithm field in BinarySearchImpl refers to the BubbleSortAlgorithm bean, and when the binary search runs, it uses that algorithm to sort the array.
